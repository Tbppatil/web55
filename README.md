•	Columns in dataset
•	Importing Libraries

•	Graph which are used
•	Conclusion

1)Reason to Choose these Project-: 
As we all know that there is a pandemic condition. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) stroke is the 2nd leading cause of death globally, responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths. This dataset is used to predict whether a patient is likely to get stroke based on the input parameters like gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status.

2)Columns in dataset-:
1) Gender: "Male", "Female" or "Other"
2) Age: age of the patient
3) Hypertension: 0 if the patient doesn't have hypertension, 1 if the patient has hypertension
4) Heart_disease: 0 if the patient don’t have any heart diseases,1 if the patient has a heart disease
5) Ever_married: "No" or "Yes"
6) Work_type: "children", "Govt jov", "Never worked", "Private" or "Self-employed"
7)Residence_type: "Rural" or "Urban"
8) avg_glucose_level: average glucose level in blood
9) BMI: body mass index
10) Smoking_status: "formerly smoked", "never smoked", "smokes" or "Unknown"*
11) Stroke: 1 if the patient had a stroke or 0 if not.

3)Importing Libraries-:
So, we are going to import some common libraries such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn to build our model.
4) Pandas Methods which are used in these project-:
•	info()
•	describe()
•	shape()
•	head(),tail()
•	sort_values()

5) Graph which are used-:
•	Countplot
•	Distplot
•	Heatmap

6) Conclusion-:
In our entire work, ‘we use healthcare-dataset-stroke-data.csv’ dataset,to predict whether someone has stroke or not.
 So From analysis we conclude that, females are more likely to get stroke than males and also smoking increases the risk of getting stroke.
So as a result, We suggest peoples to quite smoking for healthy life and also take care of our other members and ourselves too..

Thank you
